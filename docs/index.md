# PayPal Developer Days 2025 Hackathon Resources
We’re excited to have you join in on the hackathon. Use this page for anything and everything you’ll need to participate and submit your project.  
 
Don’ t be shy, come say hi: we’ll have PayPal engineers and PMs on-site throughout the event to help you. We can’t wait to see what you build!  

# Requirements 
## What to Build 
Below are three challenges you can choose from. Review each of them for instructions on any account creations, etc. that you may need.  

### Challenge 1: Agentic Integrations 

Develop an agent that addresses a common business challenge that leverage MCP Server, Agentic Toolkit or PayPal APIs A few ideas to get you started are:  
* Complete a checkout process using PayPal agentic processes
* Post purchase agentic flows
* Refund and dispute management
* Subscription management

**There are two ways of connecting to PayPal’s MCP server:** 
 
* Local PayPal MCP Server Using the Agentic Toolkit: This option enables developers to download, install, and run the PayPal MCP server locally on their own machines. It supports a wide range of MCP clients, including Claude Desktop and Cursor AI. 
* Remote PayPal MCP Server: This option opens the door to a broader audience—particularly users who prefer not to install local MCP servers. With remote PayPal MCP support, users have an endpoint that any MCP client can connect to seamlessly, allowing continuity of work across clients with a simple PayPal login.
